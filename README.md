# FITM

FITM lets you share access to websites without sharing your real credentials.

FITM stands for 'friend in the middle', an analogy to man-in-the-middle but trusting that man.

It is essentially HTTP Proxy that takes ownership of cookies, storing and reinjecting them so they never reach the browser.

## Why

Sharing credentials like username and password with other people is not great. People could be saving those credentials somewhere and access the service later on, unless you change the password after that person doesn't need access anymore. And this doesn't scale very well.

Tools like 1password are awesome to share credentials, but bad actors could be abusing this. Worst case, an ex-employee could have lots of critical credentials, and unless the passwords change, those credentials are still valid.

I wanted to create a way to share access to services in a controlled manner, without sharing the credentials. Something that could grant temporary access to others, without allowing them to access in the future and without the need of constant password rotations.

## Features

- HTTP proxy
- HTTPS proxy (using self-signed CA Certificate)
- Multiple cookie buckets
- Token based user authentication
- User permissions for specific buckets
- Admin API to manage buckets and users


## How does this work

The main component of FITM is the HTTP/HTTPS proxy, and that's done using [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/). This is an awesome tool that creates a man-in-the-middle proxy (essentially the HTTP/HTTPS proxy itself) with a really good plugin system, which we use to implement the cookies logic.

The mitmproxy plugin takes ownership of cookies, storing them and re-injecting on the way back to the server, so the browser doesn't see them.

The cookie storage is organized in buckets. FITM exposes an admin API to create buckets, and when the user authenticates with the proxy they specify which bucket to use. For the storage it uses a key-value system in [vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/).

Users have to authenticate with the proxy in order to use it, and for that we use tokens. Tokens are provided on the admin API when managing users.

Permissions at the moment are specific to users on buckets and it's impossible for a user to access a bucket without the right permission. This is implemented using vault policies.

## HTTPS support

FITM uses [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) under the hood. In order for mitmproxy to tunnel HTTPS requests,the user
has to install the CA Certificate generated by mitmproxy. When using the provided docker compose file, the generated
certificate can be found here: `$HOME/.config/fitm/dotmitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem`

More info about how certificates work in mitmproxy [here](https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/concepts-certificates/)

## Future ideas

1. It'd be good to have different roles for each bucket, and with certain constraints. For example, and admin on a bucket would be able to navigate freely to any website, but a `user` of the bucket might not have access to change the password on certain websites. This could be part of the bucket configuration where the admin adds restrictions for certain roles.
2. User authentication should be improved. At the moment it uses tokens that are sent to the API when signing up a new user. This is too centralized. We could use any other authentication mechanism, but keeping in mind that proxyauth only allows username-password authentication. Maybe it's worth exploring other client-side authentication mechanisms for http proxies.
